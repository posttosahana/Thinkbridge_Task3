Thinkbridge Task 3

Usablilty Suggestion :


1.Form Size: Keep It Minimal
2.Placeholder in every field makes user to understand better
3.One Click Registration using Gmail, FB or any other social media.
4.Rather than giving all the forms in a single place we can give each and every section in separate forms and we can provide scroll bar to display progress level


Functionality Suggestion:


1.Can load a mobile code (for India +91) by defalut in registration page based on location
2.Textbox size should be even
3.Empty lines should be removed
4.Empty blank page should be removed
5.Space or separation is missing between radio buttons
6.Consistency(Letter casing) not maintained in radio box texts
7.Predefined answers or placeholder texts may help user to understand easy
8.Line rules can be hidden

UI Aesthetic:


1.Small quotes can be used in Sign up page to attract more users ... "Its quick and easy" or "Can Access the application in 1 min"
2.Everyone wants their account more secure and can mention the how secure our application to create a trust among people
